# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project involves the development of a predictive model to assess the likelihood of survival during the Titanic sinking. The goal was to create a system that predicts survival based on various factors like socio-economic status, age, and gender.

## Overview

The primary objective of this project was to build a machine learning model capable of predicting survival probabilities using historical Titanic passenger data. This predictive model aimed to explore patterns and correlations within the dataset to determine key factors influencing survival rates.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of Titanic passenger information, including features like:
- Passenger class
- Age
- Gender
- Ticket fare
- Cabin information
- Survival status

## Project Structure

- `csv data`: The root repo. folder contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `notebook`: Jupyter Notebook showcasing data exploration, preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: Overview and details of the project.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation:** Preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and perform feature engineering.
2. **Model Development:** Implement machine learning algorithms to train a predictive model using the prepared dataset.
3. **Model Evaluation:** Assess the model's performance using evaluation metrics and visualize the results.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Arnav-Kumar1/titanic_survival.git
    ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory and run the Jupyter Notebooks to follow the step-by-step process.
2. Explore the scripts in the `src/` directory for data preprocessing, model creation, and evaluation.
3. Experiment with different algorithms and techniques to improve the model's predictive performance.
